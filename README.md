# Researcher_trajectory
This code is to analyse the trajectory of a researcher based on the data publicly available in Google Scholar.

For the Python notebook I used Google Colab and for the network initially I used networkx library to draw the network and later downloaded the .gefx file to make further modifications in Gephy.
